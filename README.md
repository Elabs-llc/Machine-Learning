# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository!. This repository contains code for various machine learning codes and projects I have worked on why learning and exploring the field of machine learning.

## Project List
1. Project 1: **Pandas**
    - Under pandas, I learned pandas series and dataframe, where i worked on series of projects and can be found in `learn_pandas.ipynb`
    - Link: [Pandas Code](https://github.com/Elabs-llc/Machine-Learning/blob/main/learn_pandas.ipynb)

2. Project 2: **Numpy**
    - Under numpy, I learned arthmetic operations, numpy arrays, and some complex mathematics such us: `matrices`, `derivative`, `variance` etc.
    - I also learned numpy Transpose `T`, `reshape()`, `dot()`, comparsion operators, and turning images into numpy arrays.
    - Link: [Numpy code](https://github.com/Elabs-llc/Machine-Learning/blob/main/learn_numpy.ipynb)

3. Project 3: **Matplotlib**
   - Under matplotlib:
   - I learnt how to plot data using hist, pie, bar, linechart etc.
   - I also learnt how to plot pandas dataframe using matplotlib
   - Learned how to use OOP inmatplotlib eg. <br>
         -
           `fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))`<br>
           `scatter = ax.scatter(
             x=over_50["age"],
             y=over_50["chol"],
             c=over_50["target"])`<br>
            `ax.set(title="People Ages - Cholestrol", xlabel="Age", ylabel="Cholestrol");`<br>
            `ax.legend(*scatter.legend_elements(), title="Target");`<br>
            `ax.axhline(y=over_50["chol"].mean(), linestyle="--");`

5. Project 4: **Scikit-Learn**
   - Unde scikit-learn, I learned about
   - An end-to-end Scikit-Learn workflow
   - Getting the data ready
   - Choosing the right estimator/algorithm for our problems
   -  Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
   -  Evaluating the mode
   -  Save and load the model
   -  Putting it all together!
   -  ##### Conclusion: This wasn't easy at all. But was able to learn everything

## Note:
To run codes in this repository, make sure you've latest python installed (Python 3.12.4 - lates version now)
and install the following modules
1. `pip install pandas`
2. `pip install numpy`
3. `pip install requests`
4. `pip install matplotlib`
5. `pip install scikit-learn`
   <u>You can also use conda to install the modules</u>
   e.g
   `conda install jupyter notebook`

   Jupyter notebook must be install to run the files.
   

## Feedback
I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contribution the projects in this repository. Feel free to create issues or pull request if you have any ideas to share.

##### Happy coding and exploring the world of machine learning
