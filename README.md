# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository!. This repository contains code for various machine learning codes and projects I have worked on why learning and exploring the field of machine learning.

## Project List
1. Project 1: **Pandas**
    - Under pandas, I learned pandas series and dataframe, where i worked on series of projects and can be found in `learn_pandas.ipynb`

2. Project 2: **Numpy**
    - Under numpy, I learned arthmetic operations, numpy arrays, and some complex mathematics such us: `matrices`, `derivative`, `variance` etc.
    - I also learned numpy Transpose `T`, `reshape()`, `dot()`, comparsion operators, and turning images into numpy arrays.


## Feedback
I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contribution the projects in this repository. Feel free to create issues or pull request if you have any ideas to share.

##### Happy coding and exploring the world of machine learning
